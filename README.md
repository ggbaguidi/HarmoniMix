### Spotify API Setup

To use HarmoniMix, you'll need to set up a Spotify Developer account and create an application to obtain the required credentials.

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in or sign up for a Spotify account.

2. Create a new application and note down the `Client ID`.

3. Set the Redirect URI in your Spotify application settings to `https://localhost:3000/callback` or the URL where your local instance is running.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   ```

   Replace `your_spotify_client_id` and `your_spotify_client_secret` with the values from your Spotify application.

5. Restart your HarmoniMix application.

Now, you're all set to run HarmoniMix locally with Spotify integration!
